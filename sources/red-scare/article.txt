Patriotic Women's League Denounces 'Bolshevist' Tendencies in Social Reform
From The Daily Sentinel, March 15, 1920

At a packed rally in Chicago yesterday, the Patriotic Women's League issued a stern warning against what it called "Bolshevist infiltration" of American social reform movements. Mrs. Edward H. Simmons, president of the League, declared that many organizations advocating for women's rights, labor protections, and child welfare are serving as fronts for communist subversion.

"We have uncovered disturbing connections between so-called 'progressive' women's groups and known radical elements," Mrs. Simmons stated. "The campaign for the Sheppard-Towner Act, for instance, is not merely about maternal health—it is a Trojan horse designed to expand federal power and undermine parental authority. These reformers use the language of compassion to mask their true aim: the overthrow of American institutions and the imposition of collectivist tyranny."

The League distributed pamphlets linking several prominent suffragists and social workers to organizations that had been investigated by the Lusk Committee. One pamphlet alleged that the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom had exchanged letters with Soviet agents. "When women abandon their traditional roles to engage in political agitation, they become easy prey for foreign ideologies," Mrs. Simmons argued. "The Red Scare is not just about bombs and strikes; it is about the subtle corrosion of our values from within."

In response, the League announced the formation of a "Watchdog Committee" that will monitor women's organizations for signs of radicalism and report any suspicious activities to the Department of Justice. The committee urged "true American women" to focus on charitable work within their communities rather than supporting national reform campaigns that, in the League's view, pave the way for revolution.
