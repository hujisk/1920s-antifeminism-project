The Threat of Feminism to the American Home
Published by the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage, 1921

Excerpt:

The American home is the foundation of our civilization. It is the sanctuary where children are raised with proper moral values, where husbands find solace after their labors, and where the sacred duties of womanhood are performed with grace and devotion. The so-called "feminist" movement, with its demand for equality in the public sphere, threatens to dismantle this cornerstone of society. By encouraging women to abandon their natural roles as mothers and homemakers, feminism promotes a selfish individualism that undermines the family unit.

We must recognize that the push for federal social programs—child care, mothers' pensions, even the Sheppard-Towner Act—is not about helping women, but about transferring the authority of the family to the state. Once the government assumes responsibility for the welfare of children and mothers, it weakens paternal authority and maternal responsibility. The feminist agenda is, at its core, a socialist one: it seeks to collectivize the family and erase the distinctions between men and women that have been ordained by nature and sanctified by tradition.

Let us not be deceived by the rhetoric of "progress" and "rights." The true progress of our nation depends on the stability of the home. The true rights of women are fulfilled not in the polling booth or the factory, but in the loving care of their families. We call upon all patriotic women to reject the siren song of feminism and to defend the American home against this insidious threat.
